Project Title:
Build an AI Agent to Answer E-commerce Data Questions
Datasets Provided
You will be given the following datasets:
● Product-Level Ad Sales and Metrics
● Product-Level Total Sales and Metrics
● Product-Level Eligibility Table
Objective
Your task is to build an AI agent that can:
● Answer any question related to the data provided.
● Receive questions via API endpoints, query the data, and respond with accurate
answers.
● Bonus: If possible, visualize the results and provide streamed responses (like live
typing effect).
Steps to Follow
1. Convert the datasets into SQL tables.
2. Choose an LLM (Large Language Model) that can run locally (downloadable and
usable without internet).
3. Write a codebase that connects:
○ The LLM,
○ The SQL tables,
○ And the API endpoints to receive and respond to questions.
4. Implement logic so the AI agent can:
○ Understand the question,
○ Convert it into an SQL query,
○ Fetch the answer from the database,
○ And return it in a human-readable format.
5. (Bonus) Add:
○ Graphs/visuals for certain queries,
○ Event streaming responses to simulate real-time interaction.
Final Deliverables
● The complete codebase should be in the github and share the github link in the form.
● A separate demo video answering these example questions (recording must contain
both the API call made and the output from terminal) - Upload in a drive and share it.
1. What is my total sales?
2. Calculate the RoAS (Return on Ad Spend).
3. Which product had the highest CPC (Cost Per Click)?
Tips for Success
● Focus on structuring the data correctly in SQL.
● For LLM you can do any of the following:
○ Select an efficient, local LLM.
○ Use an already available free LLM API like Gemini 2.5 by google

● Make sure your system is modular: the LLM should translate the user's question to SQL,
query the database, and send back a clean response.
● Add optional support for charts using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly for bonus points.
